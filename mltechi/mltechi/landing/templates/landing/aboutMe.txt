                I began teaching myself how to program in mid 2016 and never looked back. 
                My first language was python and my first program was a "Macintosh cache cleaner" hacked together script that helped speed up the time it would take me to go through a clients macbook and clean their cache manually.
                Building that and using it with my work inspired my coding career and set my path over the next 5 years.
